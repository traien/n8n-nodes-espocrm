### Advanced Filtering Example

```json
{
  "operation": "getAll",
  "entityType": "Lead",
  "filterOptions": {
    "where": [
      {
        "type": "and",
        "value": [
          {
            "type": "equals",
            "field": "status",
            "value": "New"
          },
          {
            "type": "greaterThan",
            "field": "createdAt",
            "value": "2024-01-01"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "orderBy": "createdAt",
    "order": "desc",
    "maxSize": 50
  }
}
```

### Attachments & Documents

You can upload files to EspoCRM as `Attachment` records and then create a `Document` that references the uploaded file. You can also download attachments to binary output in n8n.

1) Upload an Attachment

- Add an `EspoCRM` node
- Resource: `Attachment`
- Operation: `Upload`
- Fields:
  - `Binary Property`: name of the binary key on the incoming item (default `data`)
  - `Related Type`: usually `Document` (but can be any entity supported by your instance)
  - `Field`: usually `file` for Document’s File field
  - `Role`: defaults to `Attachment` (other roles: Inline Attachment)
- The node derives `name`, `type`, and `size` from the binary; you can override `name` and `type` in Additional Fields
- Output contains the created Attachment `id`

2) Create a Document linked to the uploaded file

- Add a second `EspoCRM` node
- Resource: `Document`
- Operation: `Create`
- Fields:
  - `Name`: document name
  - `File ID`: reference the Attachment `id` (from the previous step)
  - Optional: `Publish Date` (date only is expected; we normalize inputs), `Status`, `File Name`, `Folder ID`, `Description`, `Assigned User ID`

3) Download an Attachment

- Add an `EspoCRM` node
- Resource: `Attachment`
- Operation: `Download`
- Fields:
  - `Attachment ID`: the Attachment record ID
  - `Binary Property`: output key to store the file (default `data`)
- Output: one item with `binary[Binary Property]` populated, including `fileName` and `mimeType`

Notes:
- EspoCRM may restrict allowed file types by extension/MIME. If you receive `403 Not allowed file type`, verify your instance settings and the file’s extension/MIME.
- For attachment-multiple fields (e.g., `Note.attachments`), upload first, then create/update the parent entity with `attachmentsIds` including the returned attachment ID (remember to include existing IDs when updating to avoid unlinking).
